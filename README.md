# Vau-Wars

Year 5125 A.D., the Vau, tired and worried by the ever-growing Empire presence at their border, attacked the humanity. They hitted fast and heavy the Empire. After a few months from the attack, Byzantium II got sieged and bombarded by a huge Vau fleet. The Hawkwood-blood Emperor and its court died in the attack.
Year 5127 A.D., the Vau installed a human puppet Emperor, removing all the voting system created by Vlad.
Current year is 5130 A.D., the 5 royal Houses lost most of their worlds to the Vau-controlled Empire and to local insurgency. They also lost most of their technological capacity. The church land is confined to Holy Terra and the League has lost most of its worlds outside Leagueheim.
Decados House decided to pledge its loyalty to the Vau-Emperor as a way to survive, for now...
